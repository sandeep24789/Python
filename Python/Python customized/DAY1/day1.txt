demo to print 
print("welcome to python")

In python you no need to use semicolon

In python older version like 2.x we no need to give parnthiesi but in 3.x version  we must provide this paranthesis

Basic syntax
>>> Python execute as REPL
Read 
Execute
Print
Loop
>>>2+2
>>>8*7
>>>-76+43
>>>25/7
3
>>>25//7

exponent 2*2*2
2**12

order of execution
PEMDAS
p -Paranthesis
E-  Exponent
M -Multiple
D- Divide
A- Add
S- Sub

(2+4) * 4 / (6-2)
Variables
Variable is a container for the values
python is a case sensitive language
>>>sam=6
>>>sam
6
>>>sam +67
special variable _ will print the recent value print in repl
>>> _
6
>>> _ + 3
9

if you want to get data from a user using standard input device
>>>a = input("enter the value")	
>>>a
>>>a+21
it will show a error
to get the data as int we have to type cast
>>> a= int(input("enter the value"))
>>> a * 2
>>>a= float	(input("enter the value"))


>>> print("Sample String")
() is requried from python 3 versions
String
>>> 'welcome to python'
>>>"welcome to python"
>>> """welcome to python"""

>>> 'welcome to don'\t'	
\ is a escape charater
to print escape charter \\

to print the length of the string len(a)

+ in string is concat the string

if you want to print the string n times

>>>a * 100
n=10
a="hello"
>>> n + a 
>>>error
to solve it >>>(str(10) + a)

Variable types

Save and run



Basic operators
Decision making

if condition:
    print ("True")
else:
    print ("false")


 if(x<0):
	print ("abc")
elif(x>0):
	print("xyz")
else:
	print("ijk")

	
Loops

count = 0
while (count < 9):
   print 'The count is:', count
   count = count + 1

while loop with else

count = 0
while count < 5:
   print count, " is  less than 5"
   count = count + 1
else:
   print count, " is not less than 5"

for loop

for iterating_var in sequence:
   statements(s)

for w in words:
     print(w, len(w))


range()
